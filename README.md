## 🎯 The Mission

Every breath matters. Yet millions across West Africa and beyond lack access to reliable air quality data. The kind that can mean the difference between a safe morning jog and a trip to the hospital.

Mframapa AI bridges this critical gap by transforming NASA's satellite data into actionable 48 hour air quality forecasts. Born from the NASA Space Apps Challenge, we're democratizing environmental intelligence for communities that need it most.

## ✨ What Makes Us Different

### 🔮 Crystal Ball for Air Quality
Get precise 48 hour predictions for the pollutants that matter. PM2.5, O₃, NO₂, and more. We don't just tell you the air is bad. We tell you *when* it will be bad.

### 🎯 Your Personal Air Quality Guardian
Create your health profile and receive tailored recommendations. Asthmatic? Elderly? Athlete? We've got custom insights just for you.

### 🌐 Truly Global, Locally Smart
Our North America model leverages dense EPA sensor networks for urban precision. Our Ghana and West Africa model is specially trained for regions where data is sparse and every prediction counts.

### 🔬 Tools for Change Makers
Compare locations to see how your city stacks up against others. Dive into historical data to understand pollution patterns over time. Use our policy dashboard to empower decision makers with insights. Connect air quality to community wellness with health impact analytics.

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic

**Machine Learning Core**

We use XGBoost and Scikit Learn for predictive modeling. Python and Pandas handle the data orchestration.

**Frontend Experience**

Streamlit powers an intuitive, responsive interface.

**Data Sources**

NASA gives us the advantage. MERRA-2 provides global atmospheric reanalysis. TEMPO offers high resolution pollution monitoring. EPA sensors give us ground truth validation. Regional networks contribute local data integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.8 or higher, pip package manager, and a desire to breathe easier.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the future of air quality
git clone https://github.com/yoadjei/Mframapa-AI
cd Mframapa-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the application
streamlit run app.py
```

### First Launch
Once running, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser. Select your location. Check your 48 hour forecast. Create a health profile for personalized insights. Then breathe easier knowing what's ahead.

## 🌟 Use Cases
